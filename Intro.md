This lab course supplements [BIO102: Introduction to Evolutionary
Biology and Ecology](/courses/bio102/).  Although we cannot virtually
replicate a true lab experience, this “lab” will allow you to become
familiar with scientific thinking and techniques, and will enable you to
explore some key principles of evolutionary biology and ecology. The
material in this lab supplement directly relates to the material covered
in the lecture and reading portion of the course.  While the lecture and
reading portion focuses on big-picture concepts, here we will focus more
on visual understanding, application, and practical use of your
knowledge.  In each unit, you will work through tutorials related to
important scientific concepts and then will be asked to think creatively
about how your knowledge can be put to practical or experimental use.
