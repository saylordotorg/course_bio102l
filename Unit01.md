**Unit 1: A Scientific Understanding** <span id="1"></span> 
*You have already done some exercises related to the scientific method
in [BIO101](../../courses/bio101/).  This unit, however, will focus on
the scientific method in greater depth, examining its importance within
scientific thinking as well as its applications.  Understanding
scientific thinking is particularly important for a course focusing on
evolution.  Since it was first put forth, the concept of evolution has
been received with much hostility from a variety of sources outside of
science; to understand why and how the theory of evolution has become
near universally accepted within the scientific community, you must have
a concrete understanding of the scientific method.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 2 hours to complete.

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Design an experiment.
-   Distinguish between testable hypotheses and non-testable
    “experiments.”
-   Analyze and critique the experiments of others.
-   Identify and evaluate components of experiments.

**1.1 Definition and Concept** <span id="1.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: College of DuPage’s Center for Independent Learning:
    Professor Lynn Fancher’s “The Great ‘SM’”**
    Link: College of DuPage’s Center for Independent Learning: Professor
    Lynn Fancher’s “[The Great
    ‘SM’](http://www.cod.edu/people/faculty/fancher/SciMeth.htm)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this webpage on the scientific method in its
    entirety; it will both detail the basics of the process to you and
    explain how and why the scientific method is a conceptual
    underpinning of scientific research and thought.

**1.2 Applications** <span id="1.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: Oklahoma City Community College Biology Labs Online:
    Professor Dennis Anderson’s “The Scientific Method”**
    Link: Oklahoma City Community College Biology Labs Online: Professor
    Dennis Anderson’s “[The Scientific
    Method](http://www.occc.edu/biologylabs/Documents/Scientific%20Method/Scientific_method.htm)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Click on and read through the five examples (Car,
    Disease Detective, Forensics, Yeast, Frog) of how the scientific
    method has been or can be used.  Please note that the **correct**
    link for the frog exercise is the following: Hartwick College:
    Professor Sessions’ “[Deformed Amphibian
    Research](http://info.hartwick.edu/biology/def_frogs/)” (HTML);
    click on choice 2 (“find out for myself”) to read about this
    research.  Finally, click on “Pseudoscience” and choose one of the
    examples given in order to get a sense of how non-science is often
    presented in a scientific manner.

     Instructions: Complete this assessment once you have finished the
    above-assigned resources in Unit 1.  Read through this page of
    tutorial on the scientific method to learn more about the terms used
    to describe aspects of experimental design.  Then click on number
    three at the bottom of the page, “The Scientific Method Quiz,” to
    test your understanding of the process and terms.
