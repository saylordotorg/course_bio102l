**Unit 2: Genetics, Heredity, and Inheritance** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this section, you will have an opportunity to put your understanding
of Mendelian genetics and inheritance to use by engaging in virtual
experiments and problem-solving exercises.  These exercises will not
only provide you with an opportunity to test your skills but will give
you a better sense of how our knowledge of inheritance patterns is used
to answer current biological questions.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 5 hours to complete.

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Identify and describe the types of Mendelian inheritance.
-   Design experiments based on Mendelian inheritance patterns.

     Instructions: Read through each of these tutorials and answer all
    problem-set questions.  Please note that in order to continue from
    the first page through the Color Blindness tutorial and problem set,
    you must click on the link at the bottom of the page titled “Brief
    introduction to sex-linked inheritance.”

     Instructions: Although the initial illustrations may look more
    kid-friendly than college-level, this is an excellent introductory
    exercise that will not only ask you important questions but will
    also introduce you to lab-work and techniques involved in real
    genetics research.  Go through all of the steps of this interactive
    exercise, which will allow you to learn about experimental
    procedures (including sexing fruit flies) and statistical analyses
    while also testing your understanding of autosomal and sex-linked
    inheritance.

    Virtual Lab,” and “Sample Exercises”**
    Link: MIT: StarGenetics: “[User
    Manual](http://web.mit.edu/star/genetics/documentation/index.html),”
    (HTML) “[Mendelian Genetics Virtual
    Lab](http://web.mit.edu/star/genetics/index.html),” (HTML, Java) and
    “[Sample
    Exercises](http://web.mit.edu/star/genetics/problemsets/index.html)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read the User Manual and download the StarGenetics
    application (this will require Java).  Browse the sample exercises
    and choose an exercise to work on.  There are no answer keys for
    these exercises, but they will allow you to test your own
    understanding of inheritance across generations and will give you
    the license to experiment with your own choice of experimental
    crosses.  If you’d like some guidelines for working through one of
    these exercises, please go to “Fruit Fly Exercise 2, Level One” on
    the “Sample Exercises” page linked above, and check your work
    against The Saylor Foundation’s “[BIO102 Lab Answer
    Key](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/BIO102LAB-AnswerKey-FINAL.pdf).”
