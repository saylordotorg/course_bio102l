**Unit 3: Natural Selection** <span id="3"></span> 
*The lecture portion of this course will have taught you a great deal
about Darwin’s theory, the support it has garnered over time, and the
kinds of selection and selective pressures that have been observed in
nature.  This unit will let you examine the process of natural selection
in a more hands-on fashion, by working with simulations and models and
by learning about current scientific research that makes use of
evolutionary understanding. *

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 6 hours to complete.

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Describe the process of natural selection and the factors involved
    in influencing selection.
-   Design studies that will allow you to (at least through comparison)
    answer questions about how various traits developed.
-   Design experiments that let you distinguish between natural and
    sexual selection.

     Instructions: First, click on the left-hand link labeled
    “Activities” and click on the EvoDots simulation.  Open and read the
    EvoDots tutorial (which will explain how the otherwise-cryptic
    simulation works), then download the EvoDots software. Run
    simulations for at least three generations, and run them for at
    least two of the three natural selection criteria (“size,” “speed,”
    and “visibility”).  Note that although the program controls the type
    of variation, you control the means of selection, as your swiftness
    and rapacity with your cursor will simulate the selection pressure
    of a predator.

     Instructions: Click on the left-hand link labeled “Chapter Study
    Questions.”  Answer all questions, even if they do not refer
    directly to material covered in this course or lab.  Make sure that
    you write something in each of the short-answer boxes (only then
    will you be able to view the answer key).  When you are done, click
    on “submit answers for grading” to assess your answers and see the
    answer key.

    “explore the issue being investigated” and read the page in its
    entirety.  Next, click on the tab for the original research paper;
    you may choose whether or not to read the entire paper, but you must
    read the abstract (one paragraph).  If you do not read the entire
    paper, click on “gain an overview of the experiment” to read about
    the experimental methods and results.  Finally, click on “run a
    virtual experiment exploring the original paper”; although some of
    the “work” of this experiment is done for you, you will still have
    the opportunity to make your own observations and choose
    interpretations of the data.

     Instructions: Since you will have already read about John Endler’s
    research, you may choose to skip the introduction to this
    interactive exercise and click on the lower right-hand link to the
    “simulation.”  Here you will be able to create your own model
    environment, choosing the degree of predation pressure and the
    initial numbers of brightly colored guppies, to determine how this
    population will change over generations.  If you wish, you can also
    click on the lower-left-hand “Guppy Gallery” to see the wide natural
    color variation in guppies of this species along with their natural
    predators and habitats.
