**Unit 4: Evolution of Populations** <span id="4"></span> 
*Now that you have had an opportunity to see simulations of natural
selection, you will be able to delve deeper into the topic by examining
the ways in which alleles and allele frequencies, along with population
sizes, are affected by various selection pressures.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 1.5 hours to complete.

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Discuss how natural selection occurs on a population level.
-   List the factors that influence how, and how quickly, selection
    pressures affect populations, and design experiments to test those
    factors’ influence.

     Instructions: This simulator will permit you to alter allele
    frequencies and observe their change over many generations under
    various environmental conditions.  Read the introduction and
    instructions on the left side of the page (scroll down to read
    all).  Run the simulator once using the pre-set options for
    environment and allele frequency; then run the simulator three more
    times with different environments and/or allele frequencies of your
    choice.  Before beginning the simulations, look over the questions
    in the Journal tab at the bottom of the screen; then choose your
    simulations with those questions in mind.
