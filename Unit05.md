**Unit 5: Speciation** <span id="5"></span> 
*This unit will cover the topic of speciation in more depth than the
lecture portion of your course, detailing specific examples of
speciation and researchers’ efforts to identify how this speciation
occurred.  It will also provide you with opportunities to test your own
understanding of the process and put forth your own most-likely
hypotheses.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 1.5 hours to complete.

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Describe the various types of speciation and under what situations
    they might occur.
