**Unit 6: Phylogeny and Taxonomy** <span id="6"></span> 
*Identifying organisms’ evolutionary relationships is a critical part of
biology; it helps researchers understand species’ developmental and
ecological connections to one another.  But there is a science to
taxonomy and phylogeny, and the methods through which organisms have
been identified and are organized continue to change.  In this unit, you
will be able to try your hand at using and constructing cladograms and
phylogenies.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 3 hours to complete.

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Explain the factors involved in creating phylogenetic trees and
    cladograms.
-   Design your own phylogenetic trees and cladograms.
