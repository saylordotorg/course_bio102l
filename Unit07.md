**Unit 7: Ecology and Ecosystems** <span id="7"></span> 
*The interactions between organisms and their environments is an area of
considerable current research both for researchers in basic biology
(studying the subject in order to increase the field of knowledge) and
those in applied biology (studying the subject with a particular
practical purpose in mind); our changing climate, human-altered
habitats, and introductions of invasive species have made ecosystems and
their ecology even more variable than ever before.  In this unit, you
will be able to examine online models and simulations that describe and
examine the effects of changes in predators, prey, and habitat on
populations and communities.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 5.5 hours to complete.

Note that this advisory does not account for the time it might take you
to complete the optional diversity study.

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   List the various factors that can influence communities and
    ecosystems.
-   Suggest situations in which certain factors would have more or less
    influence on communities and ecosystems.
-   Design simulation experiments or studies that would allow you to
    test the effects of different factors on ecosystems.

     Instructions: Click on the instructions for the first activity,
    “The Producers,” to understand the premise of the model.  Read all
    steps, then click to open the simulator and run the model.  This
    interactive lab will allow you to visualize the community
    interrelationships of niche partitioning and competition and see how
    these relationships are affected by predators (in this case, by the
    introduction of an herbivore to the two-plant community).

     Instructions: Follow the links above and choose one of the three
    activities as a field study for you to conduct. The work for Project
    Budburst and the Worm Watch are more structured, while you can use
    the directions on Conducting a vegetation study to design your own
    experiment based on what plant life is around you. Pick whichever
    project is more practical for you and interests you the most.

     Instructions: Read the overview for this activity, and then read
    through each of the Lesson’s steps and questions before beginning
    any simulations.  When you are ready to begin a simulation, click
    the “open simulator” tab in the upper-right-hand corner of the
    screen.  Take notes on your simulations such that you can answer the
    questions asked in the introductions.  (Note: you do not have to
    calculate precise figures, but you should have a sense of positive
    and negative trends).

     Instructions: Although this may appear to be oriented towards
    children, these activities, which involve placing organisms in their
    appropriate place within a food-web—with or without a “hint” about
    the organism’s diet—are actually quite challenging and end with an
    opportunity to view a more complex food web of all of the organisms
    described.

     Instructions: Read through the introduction and instructions on the
    left-hand side of the page before beginning the activity.  You must
    read through all five ecosystems, but you may choose which organisms
    in each ecosystem to click on and answer questions about.  This
    activity will allow you to investigate biomes in more detail and
    also test your knowledge of each ecosystem’s inhabitants and trophic
    relationships.
